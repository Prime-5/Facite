This is a good place to start. This poem by Maya Angelou feels intensely personal (and if you read about her, you will realise that it is kind of autobiographical. In fact, the title of her autobiography is "I know why the Caged Bird Sings"). 

For me, this poem feels personal because I remember that there was a time in my teenage when I changed parts of me (that I was alright with) because they were not good enough for the ones around me. As someone who now takes pride in being himself, the obvious (and perhaps cliche) origin story is that I used to walk around with my back hunched just because people didn't like the sight of an upright me, and if you too, curious reader, have had the unfortunate experience of "throwing away parts of yourself that no one appreciates", then I think you too will find this poem relatable.

## Caged Bird
### By Maya Angelou

A free bird leaps on the back of the wind   
and floats downstream till the current ends   
and dips his wing in the orange sun rays   
and dares to claim the sky.    

But a bird that stalks down his narrow cage   
can seldom see through his bars of rage   
his wings are clipped and his feet are tied   
so he opens his throat to sing.   

The caged bird sings with a fearful trill   
of things unknown but longed for still   
and his tune is heard on the distant hill   
for the caged bird sings of freedom.

The free bird thinks of another breeze   
and the trade winds soft through the sighing trees    
and the fat worms waiting on a dawn bright lawn   
and he names the sky his own.   

But a caged bird stands on the grave of dreams   
his shadow shouts on a nightmare scream   
his wings are clipped and his feet are tied   
so he opens his throat to sing.

The caged bird sings with a fearful trill   
of things unknown but longed for still   
and his tune is heard on the distant hill   
for the caged bird sings of freedom.

P.S: I love the line "things unknown but longed for still". I think I am going to be using this in conversations.
