I'll be honest, there are times when even the concept of "there is a light at the end of the tunnel" seems streatched.
An illusion, nothing more than a carefully crafter mirage. 

"Matches" is one of those pieces that accepts this. It accepts how broken our would can sometimes feel, and does something truly remarkable with that acknowledgement.
And it's worth noting that Guante's raw and authentic delivery makes the poem much more powerful. Thanks Button Poetry for introducing me to his spoken word poetry pieces: https://youtu.be/mIuCNwpfA-U

I'll add the last verses because those are the ones that do the magic for me
Because it's not the light at the end of the tunnel that makes people walk through it, it's the light in them.

There are no stories told in a vacuum,  
There is no prophecy lighting our way,  
There is just a lot of darkness to be afraid of,  
So it's a good thing we are not afraid.

There is no Superman in that phone booth,   
There is no rewarding our faith,  
There is no one who can save us,  
So it's a good thing we don't need to be saved.  

There are no starships in low earth orbit,  
No aliens to save us from ourselves,  
There is no voice willing to speak for us,  
So it's a good thing we know how to yell.

There is no chosen one, no destiny, no fate,  
There's no such thing as magic,  
There is no light at the end of this tunnel,  
So it's a good thing we brought matches.

P.S: On a side note, I like how the introduction goes "The reason that I'm not a nihilist, is some day I wanna live like in Star Trek".
I find it relatable that sometimes we don't accept an ideology just because it goes against the most foundational of our hopes. And what is hope if not the very fabric of our existence?
