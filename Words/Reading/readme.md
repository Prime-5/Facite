There was this question on Quora that went "Why do people write?", and one of the most relatable reason, apart from being able to express oneself, was that people write because at some point in their lives, the written word had saved them.

Which is true in my case. In my coldest hours, I sometimes turn to words seeking warmth, and I have often found hope in phrases and passages.

Apart from hope, words are a great means of getting new perspectives. And just like the world was a more interesting place after we learned how to code (because it added a new dimension of thinking), a new perspective can really bring about a lot of positive change.

So here I will be sharing the words that have moved me the most.
