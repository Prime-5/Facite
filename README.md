# Facite

Facite is borrowed from Latin and if I am right, it means to "do" something, which is the essence of this repo - it will contain anything that is fascinating enough to be saved :)

I have tussled with the idea of making a portfolio for a long time now, but what always lets my heart down is that I get the feeling of "selling" my work, maybe a good designer will solve the issue? But I am kind of an old soul, and I would like some of the most important parts of me to be present in the raw form, so here it is. 

This repo will be what I am beyond my resume. What my Linkedin profile and Portfolio do not tell. So grab a snack and enjoy the ride :)
